# EM7180 USFS Sensor Calibration Utilities
Tlera Corporation offers a popular set of attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) boards known as the "Ultimate Sensor Fusion Solution" or USFS. The heart of the USFS is [EMMicroelectronic's EM7180](https://www.emmicroelectronic.com/product/sensor-fusion/em7180-sentral) sensor fusion coprocessor, which uses PNICorp's [“SpacePoint<sup>TM</sup>”](https://www.pnicorp.com/mm-module/) adaptive fusion algorithm. With proper sensor calibration, the USFS can readily provide heading accuracy of [~2deg RMS or better](https://github.com/kriswiner/EM7180_SENtral_sensor_hub/wiki/K.-Limits-of-Absolute-Heading-Accuracy-Using-Inexpensive-MEMS-Sensors).
